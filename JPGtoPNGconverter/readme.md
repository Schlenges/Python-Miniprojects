# JPG to PNG Converter
A simple Python 3 script using [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) to convert jpg images to png. The script will loop over all images in the input folder and save the converted images to the output directory.

## Usage:
Run the script by providing the **image folder** as the first argument, and the **output folder** as the second.
```bash
$ python3 JPGtoPNGconverter.py /jpg /png
```  
You may have to run the program with superuser privileges (i.e. sudo).
